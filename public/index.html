				<p>
					Whether you’re self-publishing or hoping to find a publisher for your manuscript, even the best writers depend on an editor’s eye to be sure their writing conveys the message they intend to their target audience. But great writing depends on so many aspects, and levels of editing can vary according to the state of a manuscript, whether it’s in the developmental stages, needs substantial editing, copyediting, basic proofreading, or a combination of these along the way as we work together. I’m prepared to help you with any and all of these stages of your writing as you move forward with your project.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I specialize in poetry, fiction and annotated critical literature, as well as textbooks and non-fiction. I also have experience formatting theses and dissertations to a university’s standards and have worked extensively with Chicago, MLA and APA styles.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					If you’re a publisher or a press seeking editorial services, I’m available to take on an editing test or trial project and can do so electronically or by hand. 
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					My rates are in keeping with recommendations of the Editorial Freelancers Association, of which I’m a member, but each project is different and might require variations on the standard rates. That said, I would gladly give estimates for your individual project and/or a sample edit at no cost.
